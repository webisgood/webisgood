I'm actively working at Tenstorrent India to figure out the exact rootcause of RTL bugs popping out from the 1st gen RISCV processor being developed right now.

I (still) hold a bit of curiosity for fields like Robotics, AI, 3D Modelling, etc. But since there's not much that a single person can
do by himself, I'm stuck with debugging microarchitectural fails for now (JK I enjoy my current work a lot).

Hobbies: Slice of Life Anime (Oregairu's my fav), playing TT.

Aspirations: To become a highly-established RTL designer.

Short-term goals: To get familiar with each unit of the 1st gen RISCV processor mostly, work on developing sampe test plans for better
clarity in how the ISA affects the microarchitecture, Unit DV etc.
